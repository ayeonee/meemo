# Team SONGAZI Graduation Project

### 21/02/27

Added notelist and editor.<br/>
Added meemo-server, which is linked to mongoDB.

Can concurrently run client and server with `npm start` from the root folder.<br/>
However, server will not work w/o .env file, which is not included.

Will modify code to use typescript and scss.<br/>
Will discard these logs when this feature branch is finished.
